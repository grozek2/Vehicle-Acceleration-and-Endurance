# Vehicle-Acceleration-and-Endurance
basic graphs detailing vehicle performance with fuel intake efficiency and vehicle performance

To properly run endurance.m using with two input variables, (fuelLow, and fuelFull) which respectively represent a range of fuel intake,
run endurance.m by inputting endurance(X,Y) into the command bar and replace X with a low fuel intake of 25 liters and Y with a high fuel intake
of 100 liters (or any other reasonable levels of fuel you wish). endurance.m will produce a graph with a plot detailing how long an engine 
can run (the endurance of the engine) at a specific level of power the engine works at (298 kW).
